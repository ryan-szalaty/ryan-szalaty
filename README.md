  Hello, and thanks for visiting my page. I'm a hobbyist developer looking to break into the world of software development in the next couple of years. Web Development has been my area of concentration so far, and I have built a couple of front-end applications with things like Bootstrap 5 and Tailwind CSS. 
  
  One example of a good project I've done is a Pokedex. You can see a pic here. It was made through React!

  As for backend, I'm familiar with Node.js and Express, and have used them to create a few small applications on the web as well. Deployed those with Heroku.
  
  Happy to connect with any new or experienced developers in the area (or in Tokyo), so hit me up if you are willing to help a hobbyist reach the power of the Super Saiyan God (bonus points of you know the reference). Or if you just want to chat, that's totally fine, too. I can help newbies with very small web applications using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
